I am a recent graduate with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, currently interested in Android development.

I took part in the [Google Summer of Code 2017](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2017/projects/6603273041608704/) program and worked under the [K-9 Mail](https://github.com/k9mail/k-9) organization on an advanced e-mail client for Android.

In the past, I have interned at a few startups and worked on Android applications such as [RideOnCab](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.awesomelabs.rideoncab&hl=en) and [BeatRoot](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mybeatroot&hl=en). I also enjoy contributing to open source projects.
